# Roslyn Sentinel

**Roslyn Sentinel** is a high-performance, persistent [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that gives AI agents **compiler-grade intelligence** over .NET solutions. Rather than asking an AI to guess what a refactored file should look like, Roslyn Sentinel uses the **official Roslyn compiler APIs** to perform every rename, move, extraction, and modernization with the same semantic accuracy as Visual Studio itself — and then validates the result with a real compilation pass before touching a single file on disk.

---

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhale78/RoslynSentinel
cd RoslynSentinel
dotnet publish RoslynSentinel.Server/RoslynSentinel.Server.csproj \
  -c Release -o ./publish
```

This produces:
- **Windows:** `./publish/RoslynSentinel.Server.exe`
- **macOS/Linux:** `dotnet ./publish/RoslynSentinel.Server.dll`

> **Requirements:** .NET 10 SDK or later  
> **Windows shortcut:** Run `.\scripts\install.ps1` — builds the server and prints ready-to-paste config snippets for Claude Desktop.

---

### 2. Configure Your AI Assistant

Replace `/path/to/RoslynSentinel` with the actual path to your cloned repository.

#### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

Edit `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` (create if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "roslyn-sentinel": {
      "command": "/path/to/RoslynSentinel/publish/RoslynSentinel.Server.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Windows tip:** Use `\\` as path separator: `"C:\\Dev\\RoslynSentinel\\publish\\RoslynSentinel.Server.exe"`
> **macOS/Linux tip:** Use `"command": "dotnet"` and `"args": ["/path/to/publish/RoslynSentinel.Server.dll"]`

#### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roslyn-sentinel": {
      "command": "/path/to/RoslynSentinel/publish/RoslynSentinel.Server.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor

Open Cursor Settings → MCP, or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roslyn-sentinel": {
      "command": "/path/to/RoslynSentinel/publish/RoslynSentinel.Server.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code (MCP workspace config)

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "roslyn-sentinel": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/path/to/RoslynSentinel/publish/RoslynSentinel.Server.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cline (VS Code Extension)

In VS Code settings, add to `cline.mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "roslyn-sentinel": {
    "command": "/path/to/RoslynSentinel/publish/RoslynSentinel.Server.exe",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

#### Continue.dev

Edit `~/.continue/config.json`:

```json
{
  "experimental": {
    "modelContextProtocolServers": [
      {
        "transport": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "/path/to/RoslynSentinel/publish/RoslynSentinel.Server.exe"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Verify

After configuring, reload your AI assistant and run:

```
Load my solution: /path/to/MySolution.sln
```

You should see Roslyn Sentinel confirm the solution is loaded and list available projects.

---

### 4. Running Real-Solution Integration Tests (Optional)

The test suite includes batteries that load a real .NET solution for smoke testing.
To run them, set the `ROSLYN_SENTINEL_TEST_SLN` environment variable:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:ROSLYN_SENTINEL_TEST_SLN = "C:\Dev\MySolution\MySolution.sln"

# macOS/Linux
export ROSLYN_SENTINEL_TEST_SLN=/home/user/dev/MySolution/MySolution.sln

dotnet test RoslynSentinel.Tests/RoslynSentinel.Tests.csproj
```

Without the env var, real-solution tests are automatically skipped (`Assert.Ignore`) — unit tests run normally.

## 🧠 Why Roslyn Sentinel Instead of Raw AI Edits?

When an AI agent edits code manually it is doing **text manipulation**, not semantic manipulation. That creates a class of problems that Roslyn Sentinel eliminates entirely:

| Problem with raw AI edits | How Roslyn Sentinel fixes it |
|---|---|
| **Hallucinated renames** — AI renames a symbol in some files but misses call sites hidden in lambdas, generic constraints, or XML docs | `safe_delete_symbol` / `rename` uses `SymbolFinder.FindReferencesAsync` — every reference in the entire solution, including dynamically-typed code, is found and updated atomically |
| **Broken diffs** — off-by-one line numbers, wrong context lines, lost indentation | All changes are produced by Roslyn's `SyntaxFactory` and `Formatter` — output is always syntactically valid and correctly indented |
| **Silent compilation failures** — AI edits often compile fine in isolation but break cross-project contracts | `validate_proposed_changes` runs a full in-memory compilation and returns the actual `CS1234` diagnostics before any file is touched |
| **Slow cold starts** — loading a 300k-LOC solution for every tool call takes 60+ seconds | Solution stays loaded in RAM; subsequent calls resolve in milliseconds |
| **No blast-radius awareness** — AI doesn't know how many files a change touches before making it | `preview_rename_impact` + `get_blast_radius` show exact file/reference counts before committing |
| **Destructive edits** — AI rewrites an entire file to change one method, wiping formatting, region blocks, and unrelated comments | Every tool targets a specific AST node — unchanged code is bit-for-bit identical in the output |
| **No safe-preview mode** — you only find out the edit was wrong after the file is already saved | All writes are **staged in memory** first; call `validate_staged_changes`, review previews, then `apply_staged_changes` to commit — or discard |
| **Inconsistent formatting** — different AI runs produce different whitespace | Roslyn's `Formatter.Format` normalises every touched file to the workspace's EditorConfig rules |

## 🔧 Built-in Tool Augmentations — 12 tools

These are drop-in replacements for broken or limited VS/Roslyn built-in tools. Always prefer these over their built-in equivalents.

| Roslyn Sentinel Tool | Replaces | Why | ★ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `encapsulate_field_safe` | `encapsulate_field` | Built-in generates self-referential `Field { get { return Field; } }` with the same name | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `analyze_switch_for_pattern_conversion` | *(pre-flight for below)* | Detects multi-assignment cases the MS tool silently mishandles | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `convert_switch_to_pattern_safe` | `convert_switch_to_expression` | Rejects multi-assignment cases rather than generating broken code | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `convert_string_format_to_interpolated_smart` | `convert_to_interpolated_string` | Resolves **const string format arguments** via semantic model; built-in fails on named consts | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `sort_and_deduplicate_usings` | `sort_usings` | Built-in sorts but does **not** remove duplicates | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `format_document_safe` | `format_document` | Adds true **preview support** (`preview=true`); built-in has no preview at all | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `analyze_foreach_for_linq_conversion` | *(pre-flight for below)* | Detects when collection has prior `.Add()` calls (built-in silently destroys them) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `convert_foreach_to_linq` | `convert_foreach_linq` | Only proceeds when `analyze_foreach_for_linq_conversion` confirms `IsSafeToConvert=true` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `get_workspace_health` | `diagnose` | Built-in reports `healthy:false` even when workspace is fine (tests MSBuild path, not actual load state) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `preview_add_missing_usings` | `add_missing_usings` | Built-in's `preview:true` flag is completely ignored — it always writes to disk | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `extract_constant_safe` | `extract_constant` | Uses `contextSnippet`; built-in requires exact 1-based char offsets and throws cryptic column errors | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `extract_method_safe` | `extract_method` | Uses `contextSnippet`; built-in requires line/column coordinates | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## 🤖 AI-First Tool Design: `contextSnippet`

Every tool that targets a specific code location uses a **`contextSnippet`** parameter — a verbatim substring of the source — rather than `(line, column)` coordinates. This eliminates the most common failure mode in AI-driven code edits: stale line numbers.

```
// ❌ Fragile (requires coordinate math):
introduce_field(filePath, line: 47, column: 23, "newFieldName")

// ✅ Stable (AI pastes nearby text):
introduce_field(filePath, contextSnippet: "var result = _service.Get(", "newFieldName")
```

**Rules:**
- Snippet appears exactly once → position resolved, operation proceeds
- Snippet not found → descriptive error returned
- Snippet matches multiple locations → add `lineBefore` / `lineAfter` to disambiguate

```
// When "var x = 0;" appears in multiple methods:
introduce_field(filePath,
    contextSnippet: "var x = 0;",
    lineBefore: "public void MethodA()",
    lineAfter:  "{")
```

`lineBefore`/`lineAfter` are trimmed and matched with `Contains` — indentation differences are ignored.

## ⚙️ Feature Toggles

Roslyn Sentinel has a runtime **Feature Toggle System** with ~65 named rules. Disable noisy rules to reduce analysis chatter without changing any code.

### Toggle Management Tools

```
list_features()                          → all rule names + ENABLED/DISABLED
get_feature_status(["BoxingAllocation"]) → targeted query
update_features([{"BoxingAllocation": false}, {"MultiTypeFile": false}]) → batch update
```

Changes take effect immediately for all subsequent tool calls, including `get_comprehensive_health_report`.

### Available Feature Toggle Names

**IDE diagnostic rules**:
`IDE0001` (simplify name), `IDE0005` (remove unused import), `IDE0011` (add braces), `IDE0016` (throw expression), `IDE0028` (collection initializers), `IDE0032` (auto property), `IDE0035` (remove unreachable code), `IDE0044` (add readonly), `IDE0051` (remove unused private member)

**EPC async rules**:
`EPC14` (ConfigureAwait redundant), `EPC15` (ConfigureAwait required), `EPC27` (avoid async void), `EPC33` (Thread.Sleep in async), `EPC35` (blocking in async)

## 🧪 Verification

Roslyn Sentinel is backed by **1,692 tests across 76 test files** (1,605 passing, 87 skipped for real-solution integration tests), including:
- Unit tests for every engine method
- Real-solution smoke tests against a live .NET codebase (requires `ROSLYN_SENTINEL_TEST_SLN`)
- Regression tests for every fixed bug (Batteries targeting specific CS codes and tool edge cases)

```bash
dotnet test RoslynSentinel.Tests/RoslynSentinel.Tests.csproj
# → 1,605 passed, 87 skipped
```
